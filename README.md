# Learning-GUI-with-Tkinter
A management system for an EFL school

This program was built to learn how to use Tkinter with Python.  The idea was to create
a simple program that would allow you to keep track of students and classes in an English
as a foreign language school. It allows you to create classes and add students to them. You
can mark off what lessons you have taught to the students. Simple, but a good learning experience.
